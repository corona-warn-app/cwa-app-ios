/**
A Service has to define:
- what should happen when trying to load a resource from an endpoint (load<S, R>).
- how to construct a urlRequest in dependency of the informations given in the locator and the parameters of the sendResource and receiveResource (urlRequest<S, R>)
- how a generic ReceiveResource has to e decoded (decodeModel<R>)
- how a generic ReceiveResource has to be cached or even not cached cached<R>
- if in dependency of the specific Service, some customHeaders (e.g. ETag) has to be added to the http request headers (customHeaders<R>).

	/// loads a ReceiveModel from an external endpoint via http call.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - locator: The locator of the load call. The locator contains the url, the endpoint and other describing things to build the URLRequest.
	///   - sendResource: Generic ("S") object of type SendResource. This is afaik the object to be send in the body of the http request.
	///   - receiveResource: Generic ("R") object of type ReceiveResource. This is afaik the object to be received in the body of the http response.
	///   - completion: Swift-Result of loading. If successful, it contains the concrete object of our call and is defined in the receiveResource parameter. Can be for example a protobuf or JSON object. If the load calls fails, the result has a ServiceError, which can contains a ResourceError.
