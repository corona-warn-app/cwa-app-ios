/**
A Service has to define:
- what should happen when trying to load a resource from an endpoint (load<S, R>).
- how to construct a urlRequest in dependency of the informations given in the locator and the parameters of the sendResource and receiveResource (urlRequest<S, R>)
- how a generic ReceiveResource has to e decoded (decodeModel<R>)
- how a generic ReceiveResource has to be cached or even not cached cached<R>
- if in dependency of the specific Service, some customHeaders (e.g. ETag) has to be added to the http request headers (customHeaders<R>).
