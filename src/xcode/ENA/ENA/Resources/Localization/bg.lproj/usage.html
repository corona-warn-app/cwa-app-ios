				The App is available from the Apple App Store for use on iOS smartphones
				and from Google Play for use on Android smartphones.

			General terms of use for apps from Apple or Google do not apply to the RKI.
			The RKI is solely responsible for the content of the App as well as its
			maintenance and care and for any legal claims you may have in relation to
			the App.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			By installing and using the App, you confirm that you agree to these Terms
			of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, you may not install or use
			the App (or you will need to delete it) and nor may you use the associated
			services and systems. This does not affect any rights under open-source
			licences relating to the App’s source code.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			You are responsible for compliance with these Terms of Use even if you give
			the smartphone on which you have installed the App to third parties and they
			use the App.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The App is aimed at people who are at least 16 years of age.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			1  What features does the App have?
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The aim of the App is to break SARS-CoV-2 infection chains at an early
			stage. The intention is to inform people as reliably and quickly as
			possible about encounters they have had with infected individuals and thus
			any potential transmission of the virus, so that they can self-isolate and
			help to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The App uses the COVID-19 exposure notification system provided by Apple
			and Google (<strong>COVID-19 Exposure Notification System</strong>), which
			is an integral part of your smartphone’s operating system. The exact name,
			operation, and functionality of the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System
			may vary depending on the manufacturer and version of your operating
			system. The COVID-19 Exposure Notification System is not part of the CWA
			Services or the App, but a system requirement of the App. The provider of
			the respective operating system is responsible for the availability,
			functionality, reliability and the terms of use and data processing of the
			COVID-19 Exposure Notification System. The RKI has no influence on this.
			<strong>
				<p>
				</p>
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The key features of the App are set out below. The descriptions are
			provided for your information. They do not constitute legally binding
			specifications or any agreement concerning certain features. Please also
			refer to the relevant information and reservations in Section 10.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Risk identification
		</h3>
		<p>
			After you have enabled your operating system’s COVID-19 Exposure
			Notification System and the App’s risk identification feature, the COVID-19
			Exposure Notification System starts sending random IDs via your smartphone’s
			Bluetooth interface. At the same time, the COVID-19 Exposure Notification
			System receives the random IDs of other users and stores them together with
			technical information, which is relevant for determining the risk of
			infection, about the Bluetooth signal strength (generally speaking: the
			stronger the signal, the shorter the distance), the day and the duration of
			the exposure.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			At regular intervals, the App uses the CWA Services to retrieve a list of
			the random IDs of people who have reported an infection in the official
			coronavirus app of any country participating in the transnational warning
			system, and transfers this list to the COVID-19 Exposure Notification
			System. The COVID-19 Exposure Notification System compares these with the
			random IDs stored in the smartphone to identify a possible exposure.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Risk of infection
		</h3>
		<p>
			In the event of a possible exposure involving someone who tested positive,
			the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System notifies the App and provides it
			with the information recorded about the signal strength, day, and duration
			of the contact. The App evaluates this recorded information and then
			informs you about the risk of infection identified for you, and any
			corresponding recommendations from the RKI about what you should do next.
			This may include contacting a medical professional or the local public
			health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>) and/or self-isolating at home.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Registering a test
		</h3>
		<p>
			As soon as you have been tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2, you can use
			the App to start the digital test information process and thus be notified
			of your test result. For this to work, the testing laboratory needs to be
			connected to the CWA Services and provide you with a QR code or a TAN to
			register your test. The App is only able to provide the test result from
			the relevant lab. The RKI is not responsible for conducting the test or for
			the content of the test result.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Warning others
		</h3>
		<p>
			If your SARS-CoV-2 test result is positive, you can transmit your own
			random IDs from the last 14 days, which are stored in the COVID-19 Exposure
			Notification System, as well as optional information about the onset of any
			symptoms, to the CWA Services. This will allow other people who use the
			official coronavirus app of any country participating in the transnational
			warning system to be notified on their own smartphone of any possible exposure
			involving you.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>

			Further information
		</h3>
		<p>

			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			2  What does low or elevated risk mean?
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The App calculates the user’s estimated individual risk based on the
			exposures recorded by the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System. It
			considers factors such as days since exposure, exposure duration, the
			user’s rough proximity to the person who has tested positive for
			coronavirus (based on the Bluetooth signal attenuation), and the time since
			the onset of symptoms (if indicated by the person who tested positive when
			they provided their random IDs).
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The App will then show you a “low”, “elevated”, or – if the App is unable
			to perform risk identification – “unknown” risk. This is an estimate based
			on the data provided by the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System and the
			CWA Services.
			<strong>
				This does not mean that you are actually infected with SARS-CoV-2.
			</strong>
			You may still be infected if the App shows a “low risk”, and you may not be
			infected if it shows an “elevated risk”.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Other factors can significantly affect your own personal risk of
				infection. The App does not take those factors into account.
			</strong>
			In particular, these include your own personal circumstances, the external
			circumstances of any possible exposure to a person with coronavirus, your
			own behaviour, and any exposure to third parties which is not recorded by
			the App. See also Section 4.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
				3  What should I do if I have been exposed to a confirmed case?
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			If the App notifies you of possible exposure to a person who has tested
			positive for coronavirus, it will also give you recommendations for what to
			do next. These recommendations are not legally binding, but the RKI does
			recommend that you follow them. They do not affect your legal or
			contractual obligations or any official requirements concerning what to do
			in the event of exposure to a confirmed case. You must still comply with
			any such obligations or requirements.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				No medical diagnosis whatsoever is performed in or using the App.
				<p>
				</p>
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				The notification of possible exposure does not mean that you have been
				infected with SARS-CoV-2.
			</strong>
			It simply means that you have been exposed to someone with a confirmed case
			of SARS-CoV-2 during the last 14 days. Consequently, there is only a
			possibility that you could also have been infected. The classification of
			the risk as “low” or “elevated” is based solely on the data provided by the
			COVID-19 Exposure Notification System and the CWA Services (e.g.
			information about the onset of symptoms) and does not indicate whether you
			have actually been infected.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>The notification of possible exposure may be inaccurate. </strong>
			The COVID-19 Exposure Notification System may, for example, have recorded
			the possible exposure at a time when you were not close to your smartphone or
			while someone else was using it. The possible exposure may also have been
			wrongly registered due to existing limitations in the COVID-19 Exposure
			Notification System (see Section 8).
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			4  The App does not protect you against infection
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The App serves to disrupt chains of infection.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The App will not protect you against infection with SARS-CoV-2.
					<p>
					</p>
				</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					The App will not reduce your own personal risk of infection.
					<p>
					</p>
				</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					You can still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the App
					doesn’t notify you of your exposure to the person who infected you:
					<p>
					</p>
				</strong>
			</li>
		
			<ul>
			<li>
			The App does not know about all your encounters with other people. This
			may be because other people do not use the App, you do not always carry
			your smartphone with you, or you do not always have the App running. The
			exposure logging performed by the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System
			also has certain limitations (see Section 8).
			<p>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			The App only notifies you of any possible exposure to confirmed cases if
			this has been detected by the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System and
			passed on to the App. For this to happen, the infected person must have
			activated their own app’s warning feature. Activating the warning feature
			is voluntary and some infected persons may choose not to do this.
			<p>
			</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Please also comply with all other precautions and official requirements
			when using the App. Reliable sources of information about the SARS-CoV-2
			pandemic and appropriate precautions include:

			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please follow the <strong>DHM rules</strong> even when using the App:
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>D</strong>
			- Practise social distancing of at least 1.5 m.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>H</strong>
			- Wash your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>M</strong>
			- Always wear a face mask when you go shopping and on public transport.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the best way to protect yourself and others against the virus.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			5  Retrieval of test results
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			You may only access your own test results via the App.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are awaiting test results and the CWA Services are not available or
			you cannot retrieve your test results via the App for any other reason,
			please use alternative means to obtain your result (e.g. contact the test
		provider, such as your GP or the local public health department (    <em>Gesundheitsamt</em>)). Do not wait until the App is available again.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			 6  Activating the warning feature
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			You can use the App to warn other people whom you have encountered that you
			have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
			<strong>
				You may only activate the warning feature if your positive test result
				came from an approved testing laboratory.
				<p>
				</p>
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			If your testing laboratory is not linked to the CWA Services, your
			infection status will be verified via a verification hotline set up by the
			RKI. You may not activate the warning feature on the basis of merely having
			been notified of a possible exposure.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			In cases of doubt, first contact your GP or the local public health
			department (Gesundheitsamt)
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are not sure whether you have been infected, please contact your GP
			or the local public health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>). There you
			will receive further advice and can be tested if necessary. In the
			meantime, make sure you follow the general recommendations for what to do
			in suspected cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Improper use
		</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>
				Improperly activating the warning feature is prohibited and may result
				in serious consequences.
			</strong>
			You may, for example, be liable for damages towards anyone affected.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			7  Requirements for using the App
			<p>
			</p>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The following technical requirements must be met in order to use the App:
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			You will need a data connection
		</h3>
		<p>
			Certain features of the App are based on central services and systems
			provided via the CWA Services. These features are therefore only available
			if your smartphone has an internet data connection, e.g. via UMTS, LTE or WiFi,
			enabling access to the CWA Services. Without a data connection, some or all
			of the features of the App will not be available. The same will apply when
			your smartphone is turned off, or in flight mode.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			The COVID-19 Exposure Notification System must be enabled
		</h3>
		<p>
			Your smartphone’s COVID-19 Exposure Notification System must be enabled and
			have the necessary permission for the region “Germany” / for the App.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Background updates
		</h3>
		<p>
			The App needs to run permanently in the background. You will also need to
			restart the App if you restart your smartphone (e.g. after switching it off,
			after the battery has run out or after an operating system update) or if
			the App has been forced to close.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Settings on your smartphone
		</h3>
		<p>
			To use the App, you will also need to enable the Bluetooth (BLE)
			functionality on your smartphone and allow the App to access it if requested.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			The RKI also recommends enabling the following features on your smartphone and
			allowing the App to access them if requested, although you will still be
			able to use the basic features of the App without them:
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Notifications
				<p></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Camera
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please check your smartphone settings to see whether these features are enabled
			and whether the App has permission to use them.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Detailed instructions on how to set up the App on iOS and Android are
			available on the website of the open-source project for the Corona-Warn-App
		at    <a href="https://www.coronawarn.app/en/">https://www.coronawarn.app/en/</a>
			(provider: SAP Deutschland SE &amp; Co. KG). These instructions are
			provided for information purposes only and do not form part of these Terms
			of Use.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			You will need to use a current version of the App
		</h3>
		<p>
			The RKI will occasionally publish updates for the App. You should install
			these updates as soon as possible and ensure that you are always using the
			latest version of the App. Using older versions of the App may lead to
			malfunctions and disruptions. If an update is absolutely necessary, you
			will be notified of this when you open the App.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h3>
			You will need a current version of iOS or Android
		</h3>
		<p>
			The App uses the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System implemented by Apple
			in iOS and Google in Android. This is only available in iOS version 13.5
			and upwards and in Android version 6 and upwards. Unfortunately, the App
			does not work on earlier versions of the two operating systems.
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<h2>
			8  Limitations of the App
			<strong>
				<p>
				</p>
			</strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The App is designed to help you identify a possible exposure you have had
			to another user who subsequently tested positive for coronavirus. However,
			it is important to know that the App has certain limitations, especially:
			<p>
			</p>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A possible exposure can only be assessed by the App if that possible
				exposure has been recorded by your operating system’s COVID-19 Exposure
				Notification System and passed on to the App. The RKI has no way of
				influencing the availability, completeness, correctness and reliability
				of these records in the COVID-19 Exposure Notification System.
				<p>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				The App can warn you of a possible exposure to infected users of the
				official coronavirus app of any country participating in the
				transnational warning system. To do so, however, those users must have
				provided their positive test result via the respective coronavirus app,
				making this information available for the transnational warning
				feature.
				<p>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				To assess the risk of infection, the App uses the information recorded
				about the Bluetooth signal attenuation. In principle, the lower the
				signal attenuation, the closer the smartphone. A higher signal attenuation
				can either mean that the other smartphone was further away (i.e. a distance
				of more than two metres) or that there was something between the two
				smartphones which blocked the signal. This may be an object such as a wall
				or a bag in which the smartphone was being carried, but also people or
				animals.
