		<!-- Welche Funktionen hat die App? -->
		<section>
			<h2>1. WHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP HAVE?</h2>

			<p>The aim of the Corona Warning App is to disrupt chains of infection of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage. The intention is to notify people quickly and reliably about any contact they may have had with infected individuals and any potential exposure to the virus. This will allow people to self-isolate and limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</p>
			<p>The key features of the App are set out below. The details provided are solely for your information. They do not constitute legally binding specifications or any agreement that certain features must be available. Please also consult the information and conditions contained in Section 10.</p>

			<h4>Background app</h4>
			<p>The App runs in the background on your device and automatically stores and encrypts random IDs (rolling proximity identifiers) produced by other nearby devices. The App regularly collects a list of random IDs (temporary exposure keys) via the CWA Services for those individuals who have voluntarily registered themselves as being infected. It then compares these against the random IDs already stored on the device and identifies any situation where an infection could have been passed on.</p>
			<p>The App is only able to identify and register encounters with other persons if the App is equally installed on a device carried on by such person and if such person meets all the conditions for using the App (see Section 7 below). The App is not able to register whether the user has had contact with other people as such.</p>

			<h4>Exposure notification</h4>
			<p>You will receive a notification if you have had exposure to someone who has a confirmed infection. This notification will include instructions on what you should do next. This may include contacting a medical professional or the local public health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>) and/or self-isolating at home.</p>

			<h4>Notification of test results</h4>
			<p>As soon as you have been tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, you can use the App to start the digital test notification process. You will then receive a notification of your test result in due course. The App is only able to provide the test result from the relevant lab. The RKI is not responsible for the performance of the test or the content of the test result.</p>

			<h4>Positive result</h4>
			<p>If your SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, you may use the App to voluntarily publish your own random IDs registered by the App for the last 14 days as diagnosis keys. This will enable other App users to check on their own devices whether they may have had exposure to you during that period.</p>

			<h4>Technical specifications of the App</h4>
			<p>Details of the technical features of the App and the related services and systems are available at:</p>
			<p><a>https://github.com/Corona-Warn-App</a></p>
			<p>These technical specifications are for information purposes only and do not form part of these Terms of Use. They are not a legally binding agreement regarding the quality or specifications for the App.</p>

			<h4>Further information</h4>
			<p>Further information on the App is available at: <a>https://www.coronawarn.app/en/</a></p>
			<p>Further information on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is available at: <a>https://www.zusammengegencorona.de/</a></p>
			<p>The above information is for information purposes only and does not form part of these Terms of Use.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 2. What does low or elevated risk mean? -->
		<section>
			<h2>2. WHAT DOES LOW OR ELEVATED RISK MEAN?</h2>

			<p>The App uses any confirmed exposures to calculate the user's indicative individual risk. It uses factors such as days since exposure, exposure duration, the proximity to a confirmed case based on the Bluetooth signal attenuation and any transmission risk. The App will then tell your whether you are at "low risk" or "elevated risk". This is a purely indicative assessment based on the data collected. <strong>The App cannot tell you whether you are actually infected with SARS-CoV-2.</strong> You may still be infected if you are categorised as "low risk" and you may not be infected even if you are placed in the "elevated risk" category.</p>

			<p><strong>There are a number of other factors which may affect your own personal risk of infection.</strong> The App will not take those factors into account. They include your own personal circumstances, the external circumstances of any exposure to a confirmed case, your own behaviour and any contact with anyone who is not registered with the App. See also Section 4.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 3. What do I do if I have been exposed to a confirmed case? -->
		<section>
			<h2>3. WHAT DO I DO IF I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A CONFIRMED CASE?</h2>

			<p>If the App notifies you that you have been exposed to a confirmed case, you will also receive information on what to do next. These instructions are not legally binding, but the RKI does recommend that you follow them. The recommendations referred to above do not affect any applicable legal or contractual obligations or any official requirements on what to do in the event of any exposure to a confirmed case. You must still comply with any such obligations or requirements.</p>

			<p><strong>The App does not and cannot be used to provide any form of medical diagnosis.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>The notification does not mean that you have SARS-CoV-2.</strong> It simply means that you have been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 during the last 14 days and that you may also potentially have been infected. The classification of risk as "low" or "elevated" is based solely on the available data and does not indicate whether you have actually been infected.</p>

			<p><strong>You may receive an exposure notification which is not accurate.</strong> Your device may, for example, register an exposure at a time when you are not close to your device or while someone else is using it. Exposures may also be wrongly registered due to existing limitations in contact/proximity measurement (see Section 8).</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 4. The app does not protect you against infection -->
		<section>
			<h2>4. THE APP DOES NOT PROTECT YOU AGAINST INFECTION</h2>

			<p>The App serves to disrupt chains of infection.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The App will not protect you against infection with SARS-CoV-2.</strong></li>
				<li><strong>The App does not reduce your own personal risk of infection.</strong></li>
				<li><strong>You can still catch SARS-CoV-2 without the App notifying you of the exposure to the person who may have infected you:</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>The App does not register all your contact with other people. This may be because other people are not using the App, you do not always have your device on you or you do not have the App activated at all times. There are also certain limitations in terms of contact/proximity measurement (see Section 8 below).</li>
					<li>The App only notifies you of potential exposures to confirmed cases. The App needs to have registered your contact with a confirmed case and the infected individual needs to have activated the App's warning feature. Activating the warning feature is voluntary and not all infected individuals may do so.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<p>Please use the App in conjunction with the other relevant precautions and official requirements. Reliable information on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the precautions you should take is available at:</p>
			<p><a>www.infektionsschutz.de/coronavirus</a></p>
			<p><a>www.zusammengegencorona.de</a></p>
			<p><a>www.rki.de/covid-19</a></p>
			<p>The above is purely for your information and does not form part of these Terms of Use.</p>

			<p>Always follow these <strong>rules</strong>, including when you are using the App:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice social distancing (at least 1.5m)</li>
				<li>Wash your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds</li>
				<li>Always wear a face mask when you go shopping and on public transport</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the best way to protect yourself and others against the virus.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 5. Accessing test results -->
		<section>
			<h2>5. ACCESSING TEST RESULTS</h2>

			<p>You may only access your <u>own</u> test results via the App.</p>

			<p>If you are waiting for test results and the CWA Services are not available or you cannot access your results via the App for any other reason, please use alternative means to obtain your result (e.g. contact the test provider such as your GP or the local public health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>). Do not wait until the App is available again.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 6. Warning feature -->
		<section>
			<h2>6. WARNING FEATURE</h2>

			<p>You can use the App to warn other people you have had contact with that you have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. <strong>You may only activate the warning feature if your positive test result came from an approved testing lab.</strong></p>

			<p>If the approved test lab is not linked to the CWA Services, your infection status will be verified via a verification hotline set up by the RKI. You may not activate the warning feature on the basis of a reporting of positive test result only.</p>

			<h4>In cases of doubt, get in touch with your GP or the local public health department (Gesundheitsamt)</h4>

			<p>If you are not sure whether or not you have been infected, contact your GP or the local public health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>) before activating the warning feature. They will be able to advise you what to do and you may be able to get yourself tested if necessary. In the meantime, make sure you follow the general recommendations for what to do in the event that you think you may be infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>

			<h4>Use of the warning feature without good reason</h4>

			<p><strong>You may not activate the warning feature without good reason and doing so may have serious consequences.</strong> You may, for example, be liable for damages towards any other affected individuals.</p>

			<p>In the event of any use of the App which is not in line with these Terms of Use, the RKI reserves the right to ban users from accessing the App and the CWA Services.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 7. Technical requirements -->
		<section>
			<h2>7. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</h2>

			<p>The following technical requirements need to be met in order to use the App</p>

			<h4>You will need a data connection</h4>
			<p>Certain features of the App are based on central services and systems provided via the CWA Services. These features are therefore only available if your device has an internet data connection, e.g. via UMTS, LTE or WiFi, enabling access to the CWA Services. Some or all of the features of the App will not be available if you do not have a data connection. The same will apply when your device is turned off or in flight mode.</p>

			<h4>The App must be running and activated</h4>
			<p>The App muss must be running on your device (in the foreground or background) and must be activated. You will need to launch the App for this. If you fail to launch the App, or deactivate or quit the App, it will not register any encounters with other people and will not generate any random IDs which can be stored by other devices. You will need to relaunch the App if you restart your device (e.g. after turning it off, when the battery runs out or following an operating system update).</p>

			<h4>Settings on your device</h4>
			<p>You will also need to activate the Bluetooth (BLE) functions on your device and allow the App to access them.</p>
			<p>The RKI also recommends activating the following functions on your device and allowing the App to access them, although you will still be able to use the basic features of the App without them:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>notifications</li>
				<li>camera</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please check the settings on your device to see whether these functions are activated and may be accessed by the App.</p>
			<p>Detailed instructions on how to set up the App for iOS and Android are available at <a>https://www.coronawarn.app/en/</a>. These instructions are for information purposes only and do not form part of these Terms of Use.</p>

			<h4>You will need to ensure that you are using the latest version of the App</h4>
			<p>The RKI will publish occasional updates for the App. You will need to install these updates as soon as possible and ensure that you are always using the newest version of the App. Using older versions of the App may lead to technical issues or disruptions.</p>

			<h4>You will need to have the latest versions of iOS or Android</h4>
			<p>The App uses functions implemented specifically by Apple on iOS and Google on Android ("exposure notification"). These are only available on iOS version 13.5 and upwards and Android version 6 and upwards. Unfortunately the App does not work with earlier versions of those operating systems.</p>
		</section>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<!-- 8. Limitations of the app -->
		<section>
			<h2>8. LIMITATIONS OF THE APP</h2>

			<p>The App is designed to help you identify exposures you have had to people who subsequently received a positive test result. But you should always remember that the App has certain limitations.</p>

			<p>One of these is that, while the App is constantly sending out random IDs (rolling proximity identifiers), it only receives random IDs from other devices at specific intervals. The windows for receiving data in the App are currently up to five minutes apart and are only very short.. All these functionalities are based on the underlying Exposure Notification Framework from Apple and Google and can be changed by these companies at any time.</p>

			<p>The Bluetooth signal attenuation is used for the proximity measurement. A lower signal attenuation essentially means that the other device is closer. A higher signal attenuation means that either the other device is further away (i.e. a distance of more than two metres) or there is something between the two devices blocking the signal. This might include something like a wall or a bag containing the device, but could just as easily be people or animals.</p>
