For example, contacts with users of an official coronavirus app from other participating countries can now also be taken into account for exposure logging.\n\nTo do this, the app downloads a list, which is updated daily, of the random IDs of all users who have shared their random IDs via their own app. This list is then compared with the random IDs recorded by your smartphone.\n\nThe daily download of the list with the random IDs is usually free of charge for you. Specifically, this means that mobile network operators do not charge you for the data used by the app in this context, nor do they apply roaming charges for this in other EU countries. Please contact your mobile network operator for more information.";
