Your iPhone, in turn, receives the random IDs of other smartphones. Your own random IDs and those received from other smartphones are recorded by your iPhone and stored there for 14 days.\n\nFor exposure logging, the app downloads up-to-date lists every day of the random IDs of all users who have shared their test result (more precisely: their own random IDs) via their official coronavirus app in order to warn other users. These lists are then compared with the random IDs of other users which have been recorded by your iPhone. The app will inform you if it detects a possible exposure.
