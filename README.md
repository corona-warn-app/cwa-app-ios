The goal of this project is to develop the official Corona-Warn-App for Germany based on the exposure notification API from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/). The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **native iOS implementation** of the Corona-Warn-App.
**Visit our [FAQ page](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/) for more information and common issues.**

## Development

### Setup

1. Install Xcode 12.4
2. Open [ENA.xcworkspace](./src/xcode/ENA.xcworkspace)
3. Select the right app scheme.

   We added the schema `ENACommunity` to our project which should enable third party developers to run and test the code. This schema uses a mocked implementation of `ExposureManager` in `SceneDelegate` and injects it into the application.

4. Set the user-defined variable to your development team

   In the [project.pbxproj](./src/xcode/ENA/ENA.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj) file, set IPHONE_APP_DEV_TEAM for the build setting `Community` to your development team
5. Install SwiftLint

   ```console
   brew install swiftlint
   ```

   **Note for users of Xcode 12.5 with SwiftLint version 0.43.1:**
   This particular version of SwiftLint does not detect a certain set of issues, which our CI (currently running Xcode 12.4) does.
   To mitigate this problem we use a self compiled version of [SwiftLint fixing this problem](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/3618). This version id tracked by `git lfs` which needs to be installed or supported by your git client.

6. (Optional) Set up fastlane:
   Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

   ```console
   xcode-select --install
   ```
   Install _fastlane_ using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
   ```console
   cd src/xcode && bundle install --path vendor/bundle
   ```

7. (Optional) Add code snippet to Xcode:
   CodeSnipets are located inside the folder 'CodeSnippets'.
   Copy MARKs.codesnippet  to Xcode UserData folder:
   ```console
   cp CodeSnippets/MARKs.codesnippet ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
   ```

### Build

After setting up your environment as stated in [Setup](#Setup), you should be able to build the app using the scheme `ENACommunity`.

If you want to use fastlane instead, you can do so by running the following commands:

```console
cd src/xcode && bundle exec fastlane build_community
cd src/xcode && bundle exec fastlane test
```

## Data privacy

For the possibility to read and export the log files which are created and filled at using the app, we ensure respecting the data privacy by censoring private informations (e.g. names of people in the contact journal). To ensure an efficent bug fixing on the side of the developers and testers, the corresponding information is still logged but marked as private. This affects that in release builds for the general public, the logged information is replaced by 'ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š'. It may appear an additional text which explains what information is censored at this point.

## How to Contribute

Contribution and feedback are encouraged and always welcome. For more information about how to contribute, the project structure, as well as additional contribution information, see our [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

#### SwiftLint

This project uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure a unified code style. The linter is run on every build and shows all warnings and error within Xcode's Issue Navigator.

Please ensure you have installed SwiftLint when working on this project and fix any warnings or error before committing your changes.

Use `brew install swiftlint` to install SwiftLint or download it manually from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint. When not installed a warning will be triggered during build.

## Contributors

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.
